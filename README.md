## Description

_This is a C# console application that acts as a bakery storefront. Users can decide if they would like to buy bread, pastries, both, or neither. The bakery also is running specials that can change the price and/or quantity of the order. A user inputs how many loaves of bread and how many pastries they want and the application returns the price and quantity for each as well as a total price._
